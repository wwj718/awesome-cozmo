## Before adding something to the list
1. Make sure you are editing README.md only, no other files are allowed to be edited.
2. Add your item to the category it belongs to. Try to avoid creating completely new categories.
3. Make sure your item is added to the bottom of the items listed in a category, don't add it in at the middle.
4. Don't submit dead links and try to always submit HTTPS links.
5. Make sure you're linking to an English resource, other languages not allowed *at this moment*
6. Add something that is truly awesome/interesting and stands out.


## Adding an item to the list
1. Click README.md
2. Click the *pencil button* in the upper right corner next to raw | blame | history
3. Github will automatically create a fork for this repo on your account.
4. Put your edit in.
5. At the bottom of the page fill in a meaningful commit summary and click *Propose file change*.
6. You'll be taken to the PR screen, click the *Create Pull Request* button

Submitted PRs will be checked as soon as possible. If something is incorrect it will be labeled `awaiting-user` with the problem stated in the PR comments. If a PR becomes stale or no action is taken after some time with the PR being labeled `awaiting-user`, this PR will get the `reply-timeout` label and will be closed.

Thank you for your suggestion!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
